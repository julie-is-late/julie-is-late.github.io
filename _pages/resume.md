## Experience

<!-- ### Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology
**Lecturer, Software Engineering Topics**
*Expected Mar 2025 -- Jun 2025*
- Working with Dr. Sriram Mohan, department head of Computer Science and Software Engineering, to develop a special topics course on Software Engineering
- Goal is to better educate students on problems potentially relating to: Designing easily redistributable projects, Developing and Maintaining projects with very large code bases, Ethical software engineering practices, and more
- Developing personal experience building a course from the ground up to create a learning-centered environment -->

### NVIDIA
**Senior Software Engineer, Compiler Applied ML Group**
*Jan 2019 -- Present*
- Developed a generalized, distributed optimization tool (written in Racket) for a wide variety of internal and external use cases, such as compiler optimization and hyperparameter tuning
- Researched, devised, and implemented new genetic and heuristic algorithms to better tune performance
- Developed a performance sampling tool that used probabilistic programming to more accurately calculate application performance on hardware while accounting for random variables during data collection
- Led efforts to interface with customer teams to create user-friendly tooling for a distrubted worker system, which enabled solving large-scale performance problems while simultaneously improving ease of adoption and integration
- As a direct result of my work, NVIDIA's [CUTLASS][cut] project integrated my optimization tool into their production pipeline to automatically discover optimal hyperparameter configurations before each release, ensuring maximum performance for GEMM implementations
- Cited directly as being 1 of 5 reasons our Networking Business Unit (formerly Mellanox) was able to avoid a chip redesign, saving the company tens of millions from delays

**Software Engineer, Deep Learning Compiler Verification Group**
*May 2017 -- Dec 2018*
- Worked alongside compiler developers to perform white-box testing for internal Deep-Learning graph compiler
- Reviewed project design and implementation and directly developed solutions to bugs created during development
- Wrote and maintained both functional and performance tests for NVIDIA compilers in the ML domain, ranging from C++ test cases to end-to-end tests

*Summer internships at BP3 Global (2016), Zirra (2015), and PERQ (2014)*

## Research Interests
- Studying the impact of "CodeLLMs" on student learning, particularly questions around: How do you motivate new programmers to learn core programming concepts and solve problems that "CodeLLMs" give the appearance of being able to solve on their own?
- Developing more effective methods of teaching advanced Computer Science topics related to systems computing without requiring a large number of prerequisite classes, as this has the effect of discriminating against members of underrepresented groups

## Activism and Volunteering

### NVIDIA Employee Resource Groups
**Co-Chair of NVPride and NVPride-Trans**
*Aug 2022 -- Present*
- Spearheaded community advocacy efforts to negotiate better workplace inclusion policies for LGBTQ issues, such as: codified protections for trans employees from harassment, more inclusive medical benefits for trans employees, and the right for employees to be conscientious objectors to projects they believe will harm their community
- Led meetings with company executives, including CEO Jensen Huang, to advocate for our community needs
- Co-created an anonymous relocation program for employees fleeing unsafe environments
- Fostered a safe and supportive space for employees to be seen as their authentic selves despite the surrounding environment often being apathetic and unsupportive, with a focus on being inclusive and intersectional through joint events and programs with the NVIDIA Disability Network as well as the network of Black NVIDIANs

### Big Brothers Big Sisters
**Volunteer for Big Brothers Big Sisters**
*Aug 2023 -- Present*

## Education

### Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology
**Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, Minor in Mathematics**
*Sept 2013 -- Feb 2017*
